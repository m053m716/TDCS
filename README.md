# TDCS #

Code here pertains to analyses conducted on the paper *Effects of tDCS on Spontaneous Spike Activity in a Healthy Ambulatory Rat Model*.

## Organization ##

The bulk of analyses (as run for the paper) are integrated as sub-sections of the file `Main.m`

* In order to run these analyses, you need access to the KUMC `P:/` network drive.
* Relevant default parameters are in the package `+defs`, where by convention the parameter files are each named after the associated function (e.g. `ISIDistributionFigs`, `FlatThreshRateFigs`, etc.) or generic purpose (e.g. `FileNames`, `Spikes`, and `Experiment`).
* The code in `Main.m` can take a while to run so you may want to advance through it section-by-section.

## Extraction from Binary Data ##

Neurophysiological data was extracted from binary data files using the batch processing for Intan RHD or RHS (depending on acquisition system used for the individual recording) available in  **[`CPLTools`](https://github.com/m053m716/CPLtools/tree/master/MoveData_Isilon)**. 

## Data Processing ##

1. Data is filtered

   * For Spikes, a Multi-unit Bandpass Filter was applied, followed by a common-average re-reference wherein the mean of all channels at each sample was subtracted from all probes at each sample.

   * For LFP, decimation was implemented to reduce all sampled data to 1 kHz, using a series of Chebyshev anti-aliasing lowpass filters.

2. Traces of the processed data were inspected visually to ensure that data was free of recording artifacts due to non-biological sources. This sort of artifact is very large and typically evident by visual inspection.

   * For consistency, an RMS filter was applied to 1-second-long "chunks" of non-overlapping samples, allowing us to set an automated RMS exclusion threshold based on the distribution of raw data magnitudes that automatically rejects artifacts.

3. For Spikes, units were detected and sorted using a preliminary automated sorting procedure followed by a secondary manual curation step.

After these steps, initial data processing was considered complete.
